Project Proposal: storytelling model in Kinyarwanda language
1. Introduction:
Preserving traditional cultural narratives is essential amid modernization. While technology can pose a threat to some cultural aspects, it also offers opportunities for creative arts, precisely generative art. This work  introduces a Deep Learning model tailored for storytelling in Kinyarwanda language. We propose building a text-generating model aiming at preserving Rwandan heritage. Using deep learning methodologies, our aim is to capture and replicate the essence of the old  written narratives, ensuring that this cherished art form endures for generations to come.
